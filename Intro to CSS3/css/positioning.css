/*TEST ME!!
	1) Open this page and look at it.  The 	
		paragraphs are all in their default
		location.  The top/left values are 
		ignored.
	2) Using Inspect Element, uncomment the
		next line so the position is relative.
		Each of the paragraphs have moved from 
		their ORIGINAL position
	3) Change the position to absolute.  Now they
		are placed 100 right 100 down from their PARENT
	4) Change the position to fixed.  Now they 	
		are placed 100 down and 100 right from the BROWSER*/
